# Healthy-Lifestyle-Cities

Health as a synthetic indicator of the quality and standard of living. At the same time, in accordance with the presentation of the World Health Organization, the category of health includes the categories of physical, mental, spiritual and public health. According to a study by YouGov, almost half of Brits stated improving fitness (47%), losing weight (44%) and improving diet (41%) were among their most important New Year’s resolutions for 2020. It’s no surprise that millions of people worldwide enter each New Year with the hope of taking better care of themselves, whether that’s signing up to the gym or eating healthier.

However, fitness and diet are not the only measurements of healthiness - although they do play a big part. Sometimes it’s about our surrounding environment, as well as lifestyle choices. The team at Lenstore has analysed 44 cities across the globe to uncover where it’s easier to lead a well-rounded, healthy lifestyle. From obesity levels to pollution rates, each city has been scored across 10 healthy living metrics.

### From this dataset, we can see which are the healthiest cities in the world and what factors influence it

- The first place is Amsterdam. Amsterdam ranks as the number one location for leading a healthy lifestyle across all 44 cities. Known as one of the most bike-friendly cities in the world, it’s perhaps no surprise the Dutch capital comes out on top. With over 400 outdoor activities to keep you fit and healthy, and ranking as the 5th happiest country in the world, as well as the 6th best country in Europe for obesity levels at just 20.4% (nearly 10% less compared to London at 27.8%), living in this picturesque city is the top destination for leading a healthy lifestyle.

- Followed by Sydney. Sydney experiences 2,636 hours of sunshine hours per year, attracting tourists to the famous Bondi beach, but also giving you more than enough time to take advantage of the 406 outdoor activities. This outweighs the relatively high monthly gym membership cost of £42 and with a life expectancy of 82 years, perhaps outdoor fitness is the way to go.
