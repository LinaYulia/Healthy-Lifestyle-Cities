# Healthy-Lifestyle-Cities

Health as a synthetic indicator of the quality and standard of living. At the same time, in accordance with the presentation of the World Health Organization, the category of health includes the categories of physical, mental, spiritual and public health. According to a study by YouGov, almost half of Brits stated improving fitness (47%), losing weight (44%) and improving diet (41%) were among their most important New Year’s resolutions for 2020. It’s no surprise that millions of people worldwide enter each New Year with the hope of taking better care of themselves, whether that’s signing up to the gym or eating healthier.

However, fitness and diet are not the only measurements of healthiness - although they do play a big part. Sometimes it’s about our surrounding environment, as well as lifestyle choices. The team at Lenstore has analysed 44 cities across the globe to uncover where it’s easier to lead a well-rounded, healthy lifestyle. From obesity levels to pollution rates, each city has been scored across 10 healthy living metrics.
